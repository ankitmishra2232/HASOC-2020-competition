# HASOC-2020-competition

# HASOC provides a forum and a data challenge for multilingual research on the identification of problematic content.This year, they offered again 2 sub-tasks for each language such as English, German and Hindi, alltogether over 10.000 annotated tweets from Twitter.

We participated in both of the sub-tasks in all of the three languages Hindi, English and German. The name of our team was "iiit_DWD". we took the challenge and made the model for all of the tasks.

# Sub-Task
There are two sub tasks 
# Sub-Task "A":- Identifying Hate-offensive and profane content.
In every language Sub-Task "A" is a coarse-grained label classification task that required the system to classify each twitter post into one of the two classes "Hate and Offesive(HOF)" and "Not Hate and Offensive(NOT)".

# Sub-Task "B":- Discrimination between Hate, profane and offensive posts.
Sub-Task "B" in every language is a fine-grained label classificaion task that required the system to classify each "Hate and Offensive" post into three categories "Hate Speech(HATE), Offensive(OFFN) and Profane(PRFN).
