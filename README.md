# Sub-Task
There are two sub tasks 
# Sub-Task "A":- Identifying Hate-offensive and profane content.
In every language Sub-Task "A" is a coarse-grained label classification task that required the system to classify each twitter post into one of the two classes "Hate and Offesive(HOF)" and "Not Hate and Offensive(NOT)".

# Sub-Task "B":- Discrimination between Hate, profane and offensive posts.
Sub-Task "B" in every language is a fine-grained label classificaion task that required the system to classify each "Hate and Offensive" post into three categories "Hate Speech(HATE), Offensive(OFFN) and Profane(PRFN).
